Semantic furniture classifier input data file format
====================================================

* each line represents one plane

* fields: id, pos x, pos y, pos z, normal x, normal y, normal z, size,
  size after hole closing, bbox x, bbox y, bbox z, orientation, angle
  
  - orientation: h/v/u = horizontal/vertical/unknown
  - pos x/y/z: coordinates of centroid vector
  - normal x/y/z: normal vector
  - angle: rotation around y axis in degrees (x is 0Â°; counterclockwise)
	  + horizontal surfaces: biggest PCA component
	  + vertical surfaces: normal vector
    

* fields are separated by a single space; no leading or trailing spaces

* left-handed coordinate system: x is sideways, y is up, z is forward (depends
  on scan format -- scans from the rotunit are left-handed, because slam6d uses
  left-handed coordinate system)

* units: in future: x/y/z are in m, size is in m^2 (at the moment, x/y/z are in
  cm, size is in cm^2)

* coordinate origin: in the future: y = 0 is ground level (at the moment, the
  coordinate origin is at the height of the scanner, ~30 cm)


Output format
=============

* id
* type
* centroid xyz
* bbox xyz
* angle
	- special case chairs: centroid of seat, but angle of backrest (flipped towards seat)
	- everything else (tables, shelves): biggest PCA component
* centroid angle
    - special case chairs: angle of vector from centroid of backrest to centroid of seat
	- everything else: 0.0
